# ketelhuis-interactive
An art project I built with a friend. It allowed us to interact with a live audience in a movie theater. Controlling outgoing video and audio feed and allowing us to talk to the audience using on the go Text-To-Speech
This was a project created under time pressure, it's not up to any code standards but I still want to keep a copy of it.
The video folder is missing from this project as I didn't want to bloat the repo too much. There's a good chance that'll cause an error when you try to reproduce this project because everything is hardcoded up the wazoo.

##Features
A bunch of keys are mapped to custom events like playing/stopping video and audio and showing images.
